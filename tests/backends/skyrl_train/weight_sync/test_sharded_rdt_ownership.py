"""Ownership and gather-group tests for the sharded-RDT weight sources.

The code under test is the per-rank ownership under PP/EP in
``sharded_rdt/rdt_send.py``, which is what keeps a PP-local export from
materializing the whole model on every rank.

``held_names()`` is the whole ownership contract: it declares which parameters a
rank holds, consumers route pulls by it, and the producer's free barrier counts
groups derived from it. The default (hold everything) is correct at pp=1/ep=1 and
wrong above it, which is exactly the kind of bug that shows up as a hang rather
than an error.

The sources under test implement vLLM's trainer-side ``WeightSource`` contract,
so this module runs in the vLLM test environment.
