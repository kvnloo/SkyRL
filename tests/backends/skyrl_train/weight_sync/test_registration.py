"""Tests for registering SkyRL's weight-transfer engines into vLLM's factories.

There are two registries and they are populated by different code:

* ``WeightTransferTrainerFactory`` — the send side, populated by
  ``register.register_trainer_engines``.
* ``WeightTransferEngineFactory`` — the receive side, populated by
  ``register.register_receive_engines``. It must run in every vLLM worker
  process AND on the driver, which validates ``WeightTransferConfig.backend``.

Every test here **resolves** each entry rather than asserting the key is
present. Three of the registrations pass the engine as a module path and class
name in strings, which vLLM imports only when a worker builds the backend — so a
stale path or a renamed class satisfies a membership check and fails on a live
inference worker instead.
