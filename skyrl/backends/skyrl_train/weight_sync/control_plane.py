"""Blocking control-plane client for the trainer-side weight transfer engines.

vLLM's ``VLLMWeightSyncClient`` is a synchronous four-method protocol
(``init_weight_transfer_engine`` / ``start_weight_update`` / ``update_weights`` /
``finish_weight_update``), and the engine that drives it runs off the worker's
event loop. So this client uses blocking HTTP against the same routes rather
than SkyRL's async ``RemoteInferenceClient``, keeping the whole engine
sync-to-sync with no event-loop involvement.

Four properties are load-bearing:

* **Per-call fresh connections** (``Connection: close``). A full training step
  elapses between syncs, so a pooled keep-alive connection is stale by the next
  call and races the server's ``timeout_keep_alive`` (uvicorn 5s) into
  ECONNRESET.
* **Concurrent fan-out** across servers. Required for correctness on the RDT
  path, not just speed: consumers pull in lockstep and a producer frees a served
  group only once every bound consumer has pulled, so a serial
  ``update_weights`` stalls the producer's gather loop and deadlocks.
* **Body-aware error messages** (:func:`_error_message`) — surface the response
  body's error detail, not the bare HTTP reason phrase.
* **No timeout** (an RDT bake + NIXL pull are long) and **no retry** (retrying a
  half-done stateful call would be wrong).

``requests`` rather than a new dependency: Ray provides it, and Ray is a hard
requirement of every path that reaches here. The import is local so nothing else
pays for it.
