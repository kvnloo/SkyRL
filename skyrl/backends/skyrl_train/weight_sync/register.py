"""Registers SkyRL's weight-transfer engines into vLLM's two factories.

vLLM keeps separate registries for the two directions, and they are populated by
different processes:

* ``WeightTransferEngineFactory`` — the **receive** side. Must be populated in
  every vLLM worker process (``Worker.load_model`` builds the engine through the
  factory) and on the **driver**, which validates ``WeightTransferConfig.backend``
  against the registry while building the servers' CLI args.
* ``WeightTransferTrainerFactory`` — the **send** side. Populated on each trainer
  rank, before ``trainer_init`` dispatches on ``init_info.backend``.

Both live here so the two call sites cannot drift: a backend that
``get_vllm_receive_backend`` can select but nobody registered fails only once a
real engine is constructed, inside a worker.

``delta`` is registered by module path and class name, so vLLM imports it lazily
when a worker constructs the backend. ``skyrl_nccl`` / ``skyrl_ipc`` are dynamic
subclasses of vLLM engines, so their classes are passed directly.

SkyRL deliberately replaces vLLM's native ``sharded_rdt`` engines. The backend
name stays the same, but it resolves to SkyRL's implementation on both sides.
