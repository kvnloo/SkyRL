"""Weight synchronization for distributed RL training.

SkyRL drives weight sync through vLLM's trainer-send abstraction: each training
worker builds a ``WeightSource`` over its live model (``sources.py``) and hands
it to a ``TrainerWeightTransferEngine`` (``weight_senders.py``) whose
``send_weights()`` owns the whole round trip. Four backends:

===============  ==========================================================
``nccl``         broadcast from trainer rank 0; non-colocated
``ipc``          CUDA IPC handles; colocated (``placement.colocate_all``)
``delta``        compressed checkpoint deltas via disk / ``gs://`` / ``s3://``
``sharded_rdt``  the inference workers pull slices over NIXL
===============  ==========================================================

This package imports no vLLM at module scope: half the CPU suite runs without the
(Linux-only, optional) wheel. The vLLM-facing modules -- ``sources``,
``weight_senders``, ``delta.trainer``, ``delta.engine`` -- are imported at their
call sites instead.
